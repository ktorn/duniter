Duniter (previously uCoin) is a libre software allowing to create a new kind of P2P crypto-currencies based on individuals and Universal Dividend.

Inspired by [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [OpenUDC](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc) projects.

## Development state

Software is still under development, and **no production currency using Duniter exists for now**.

However, it already exists a testing currency named [Test_Net](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813). Want to test it? Two ways.

### Add your node to the network

See [Install a node documentation](https://github.com/duniter/duniter/blob/master/doc/install-a-node.md).

### Try Cesium Wallet
- [Try Cesium Wallet](http://cesium.duniter.fr)

### Try Sakia Wallet

In the world of crypto-currencies, [Sakia Wallet](http://sakia-wallet.org) ([repository](https://github.com/duniter/sakia)) would be called a [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Simplified_Payment_Verification_.28SPV.29_Clients) client. It is a graphical client connecting to the network. See this [tutorial](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813) to join in the testing currency with Sakia.
